I'm going to join the College of Computer Science, Beijing University of Technology (BJUT) this year. 

In 2024, I received the Ph.D. degree from  Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) under the guidance of Prof. [Lingjuan Miao](https://ac.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/dhzdykzyjs1/f6bce95984dc4b34ada4be9101329eb3.htm). I received the B.S. degree in Automation from BIT in 2018. From 2022 to 2023, I conducted research as a visiting scholar in the GAIM Group and worked with Prof. [Aleksandra Pizurica](https://telin.ugent.be/~sanja/) at Ghent University (UGent), Belgium. 

My research interests include computer vision, remote sensing, IoT, edge computing, LLM, VLM, and AI4S.
